/* Notes:
 -- no text 
 -- bold 
 -- high brightness
 -- audience will be in close proximity
 -- hexals - perceived higher resolution
 -- smooth graphics
 -- animation should run for 1-2 minutes
 -- 30 frames/sec
 -- each hexal ~= 5px using a 600x200 canvas

/* Describe how you've been thinking about working with the SmartSlab:
 -- animation should catch people's attention as they walk past and possibly make them stop
 -- need a point of interest
 -- should be interesting but not distracting so people can watch while having lunch without being bored
 -- from observation, when the smartslab is filled with colour, the divisions
 in the screen (vertical and horizontal lines) become more obvious
 -- use an animation where the background is primarily black so that the 
 lines don't detract from the visuals 
 -- idea: 
 * black background 
 * top - random 'fireworks'
 * bottom - silhouettes of peoples heads, i.e. people watching the fireworks
 * every so often, one of the people turn around and wave .. this is the surprise
 * alternatively, no silhouettes but every so often a person pops up from the bottom to wave 
 - might be a better attention grabber?
 * the fireworks will be something that is enjoyable to watch as you walk by,
 and also nice to watch if you are sitting down eating lunch
 * the 'wave' will catch people's attention, in a 'oh, what just happened there?' 
 kind of way and entice them to stop and watch the animation to see if it will 
 happen again. 
 * also, instead of fireworks, it could instead be clouds drifting by 
 * some people like cloud watching, and might stop and try to spot objects/animals in the cloud formations
 * replaced people's heads with a city skyline - easier to randomly generate and perspective wise makes more sense 
 * setting the strokeweight to 5px will let me see how well straight lines turn out on the smartslab
